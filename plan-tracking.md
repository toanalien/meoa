- [x] Added master password protection for wallet encryption/decryption
- [x] Implemented blockchain utility functions for various operations
- [x] Fixed hydration issues for server-side rendering compatibility

### UI Components
- [x] Created WalletManager component for wallet management
- [x] Implemented BulkOperations component for bulk actions
- [x] Set up main page layout with tabs
- [x] Added global styles
- [x] Ensured components work correctly with SSR/CSR hydration

### Documentation
- [x] Created project README with overview and setup instructions
- [x] Added frontend documentation
- [x] Set up .gitignore for version control
- [x] Added MIT license to the project

## Pending Tasks
