# Wallet Manager Project Progress Tracking

## Project Overview

Building a service that manages wallets for users and enables bulk actions for multiple accounts such as sending, swapping, transferring, and approving transactions. The application stores user wallets in local storage with encrypted passwords and is built using Next.js with Ant Design.

## Completed Tasks

### Project Setup
- [x] Created monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces
- [x] Set up frontend application with Next.js
- [x] Configured TypeScript
- [x] Added Ant Design for UI components
- [x] Set up static export configuration for Next.js

### Core Functionality
- [x] Implemented wallet generation and encryption utilities
- [x] Created wallet context for state management
- [x] Implemented secure storage of wallets in localStorage
- [x] Added master password protection for wallet encryption/decryption
- [x] Implemented blockchain utility functions for various operations
- [x] Fixed hydration issues for server-side rendering compatibility

### UI Components
- [x] Created WalletManager component for wallet management
- [x] Implemented BulkOperations component for bulk actions
- [x] Set up main page layout with tabs
- [x] Added global styles
- [x] Ensured components work correctly with SSR/CSR hydration

### Documentation
- [x] Created project README with overview and setup instructions
- [x] Added frontend documentation
- [x] Set up .gitignore for version control

## Pending Tasks

### Backend Development
- [ ] Set up backend service with Fastify
- [ ] Implement API endpoints for wallet operations
- [ ] Add authentication and authorization

### Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for utility functions
- [ ] Add integration tests for components
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing

### Deployment
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure production build
- [ ] Deploy to hosting service

### Enhancements
- [x] Added "recommend password" checkbox when entering master password
- [x] Fixed wallet persistence in local storage when page is refreshed
- [x] Added secure master password storage for session persistence
- [x] Improved wallet storage reliability with multiple storage strategies:
  - Added new storage keys with migration from legacy keys
  - Implemented fallback mechanisms (localStorage + sessionStorage)
  - Added robust error handling for storage operations
  - Eliminated duplicate storage entries
- [x] Enhanced wallet import functionality:
  - Added bulk import from text box with multiple private keys or mnemonic phrases
  - Added bulk import from text file with multiple private keys or mnemonic phrases
  - Implemented automatic detection of private keys vs mnemonic phrases
  - Added support for default derivation path for mnemonic phrases
- [x] Made wallet name optional for create and import operations:
  - Added auto-generation of wallet names (e.g., "Generated Wallet #1", "Imported Wallet #2")
  - Updated UI to indicate name field is optional
  - Maintained sequential numbering for auto-generated names
- [ ] Add transaction history tracking
- [ ] Implement address book functionality
- [ ] Add support for hardware wallets
- [ ] Implement gas estimation
- [ ] Add network switching functionality
- [ ] Improve error handling and user feedback

## Next Steps
1. Install dependencies and test the current implementation
2. Implement backend service if needed
3. Add comprehensive testing
4. Deploy the application
